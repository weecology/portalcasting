## Overview

The `portalcasting` package offers a comprehensive system for developing, deploying, and evaluating ecological models that forecast changes in ecological systems over time. It particularly focuses on the long-term study of mammal population and community dynamics, known as the [Portal Project](https://portal.weecology.org/).

### Core Depedencies

The `portalcasting` package depends on the **PortalData**  and  **portalr** packages.

-  [PortalData](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) is the collection of all the Portal project data.
-  [portalr](https://github.com/weecology/portalr) is a collection of functions to summarize the Portal data.

The `portalcasting` package integrates the [PortalData repository](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) and the [portalr data management package](https://github.com/weecology/portalr) into a streamlined pipeline. This pipeline is used to forecast.

The functionality of `portalcasting` extends beyond its deployment, as its functions are portable. This allows users to establish a fully-functional replica repository on either a local or remote machine, facilitating the development and testing of new models within a [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_software_development) environment.

## Current Deployment:

The [Portal-forecasts](https://github.com/weecology/portal-forecasts) houses tools that leverage the portalcasting pipeline to generate weekly forecasts.
The forecasts are then showcased on the [Portal Forecasts website](https://portal.naturecast.org).
This website offers users an interactive interface to explore the forecasting results.
The source code for this website is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/weecology/portal-forecast-web).
Additionally, the portal-forecasts repository archives the forecasts on both GitHub and Zenodo

## Docker Container

We leverage a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/weecology/portalcasting) to enable reproducibility of the [Portal forecasting](https://github.com/weecology/portal-forecasts).
Presently, we use a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/weecology/portalcasting) image of the software environment to create a container for running the code.
The image is automatically rebuilt when there is a new `portalcasting` release, tagged with both the `latest` and version-specific (`vX.X.X`) tags, and pushed to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/weecology/portalcasting).

Because the `latest` image is updated with releases, the current main branch code in `portalcasting` is typically, but not necessarily always, being executed within the [predictions repository](https://github.com/weecology/portalPredictions).

The API is actively developed and welcomes any contributors.

## Installation

You can install the package from github:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("weecology/portalcasting")
```

You will need to install `rjags` and JAGS.

MacOS users are recommended to install rjags after reading the instructions on the package's README file, or use the JAGS discussion forum thread for help under the [MacOS installation of JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/p/mcmc-jags/discussion/search/?q=MacOS+installation&project=0).


```r
install.packages("rjags", configure.args="--enable-rpath")
```

## Production environment

If you wish to spin up a local container from the `latest` `portalcasting` image (to ensure that you are using a copy of the current production environment for implementation of the `portalcasting` pipeline), you can run

```
sudo docker pull weecology/portalcasting
```
from a shell on a computer with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.


## Usage

Get started with the ["how to set up a Portal Predictions directory" vignette](https://weecology.github.io/portalcasting/articles/getting_started.html).

If you are interested in adding a model to the preloaded [set of models](https://weecology.github.io/portalcasting/articles/current_models.html), see the ["adding a model and data" vignette](https://weecology.github.io/portalcasting/articles/adding_model_and_data.html). That document also details how to expand the datasets available to new and existing models.


## Developer and Contributor notes

We welcome any contributions in form of models or pipeline changes.

Nesting the forecasting directory in a folder can be done by simply adding to the \code{main} input (see \code{Examples}).}

\item{settings}{\code{list} of controls for the directory, with defaults set in \code{\link{directory_settings}} that should generally not need to be altered.}

\item{quiet}{\code{logical} indicator if progress messages should be quieted.}

\description{
The directory configuration file is a special file within the portalcasting directory setup and has its own set of functions. \cr \cr
             \code{write_directory_config} creates the YAML metadata configuration file. It is (and should only be) called from within \code{\link{setup_dir}}, as it captures information about the compute environment used to instantiate the directory. \cr \cr
             \code{read_directory_config} reads the YAML config file into the R session.

\usage{
save_cast_output(
  cast = NULL,
  main = ".",
  settings = directory_settings(),
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cast}{Output from a model function (e.g., \code{\link{AutoArima}}) run on any rodents dataset. Required to be a \code{list}, but otherwise has minimal strict requirements. \cr
Names of the elements of the list (such as \code{"metadat"}) indicate the specific saving procedures that happens to each of them. See \code{Details} section for specifics.}

\item{main}{\code{character} value of the name of the main component of the directory tree.}

\item{settings}{\code{list} of controls for the directory, with defaults set in \code{\link{directory_settings}} that should generally not need to be altered.}

\item{quiet}{\code{logical} indicator if progress messages should be quieted.}
}
\value{
Relevant elements are saved to external files, and \code{NULL} is returned.
}
\description{
Save out any output from a cast of a model for a data set and update the cast metadata file accordingly to track the saved output. \cr
 Most users will want to at least save out model metadata and a table of predictions.
}
\details{
Currently, four generalized output components are recognized and indicated by the names of the elements of \code{cast}. 
 \itemize{
  \item \code{"metadata"}: saved out with \code{\link[yaml]{write_yaml}}. Will typically be the model-specific metadata from the \code{data/metadata.yaml} file, but can more generally be any appropriate object (typically a \code{list}).  
  \item \code{"cast_tab"}: saved using \code{\link{write.csv}}, so is assumed to be a table such as a \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame}  or coercible to one. Used to summarize the output across instances of the model (across multiple species, for example). 
  \item \code{"model_fits"}: saved out as a serialized \code{JSON} file via \code{\link[jsonlite]{serializeJSON}} and  \code{\link[jsonlite]{write_json}}, so quite flexible with respect to specific object structure. Saving out a \code{list} of the actual model fit/return objects means that models do not need to be refit later.
  \item \code{"model_casts"}: saved out as a serialized \code{JSON} file via \code{\link[jsonlite]{serializeJSON}} and \code{\link[jsonlite]{write_json}}, so quite flexible with respect to specific object structure. Is used to save \code{list}s of predictions across multiple instances of the model.

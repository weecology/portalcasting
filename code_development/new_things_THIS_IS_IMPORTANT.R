cast_tab, model controls, etc
  
at this point, we need to document the predictive distribution better for evaluation
and the range of values needs to be flexible
like, for a normal distribution vs for an empirical distribution

each model needs to be workable within itself but we should stop assuming theyll work into a flat file across models

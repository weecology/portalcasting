<p>AutoARIMA (Automatic Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a
flexible Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA
models are defined according to three model structure parameters – the
number of autoregressive terms (p), the degree of differencing (d), and
the order of the moving average (q), and are represented as ARIMA(p, d,
q) <span class="citation">(Box and Jenkins 1970)</span>. All submodels
are fit and the final model is selected using the
<code>auto.arima</code> function in the <strong>forecast</strong>
package <span class="citation">(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Hyndman

can vary from fit to fit. Model forecasts are generated using the
<code>forecast</code> function from the <strong>forecast</strong>
package <span class="citation">(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Hyndman

seasonal models, the seasonality is hard-coded to be on the same period
as the sampling, which is not the case for the Portal rodent surveys. As
a result, no seasonal models are evaluated within this model set, but
see the sAutoARIMA model. The model is fit using a normal distribution,
and as a result can generate negative-valued predictions and
forecasts.</p>

<p>ESSS (Exponential Smoothing State Space) is a flexible exponential
smoothing state space model <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al.
2008)</span>. The model is fit using the <code>ets</code> function in
the <strong>forecast</strong> package <span class="citation">(Hyndman
2017)</span> with the <code>allow.multiplicative.trend</code> argument
set to <code>TRUE</code>. Model forecasts are generated using the
<code>forecast</code> function from the <strong>forecast</strong>
package <span class="citation">(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Hyndman
2017)</span>. Models fit using <code>ets</code> implement what is known
as the “innovations” approach to state space modeling, which assumes a
single source of noise that is equivalent for the process and
observation errors <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>.
In general, ESSS models are defined according to three model structure
parameters – error type, trend type, and seasonality type <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>. Each of the parameters
can be an N (none), A (additive), or M (multiplicative) state <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>. However, because of the
difference in period between seasonality and sampling of the Portal
rodents combined with the hard-coded single period of the
<code>ets</code> function, we do not include the seasonal components to
the ESSS model. ESSS is fit flexibly, such that the model parameters can
vary from fit to fit. The model is fit using a normal distribution, and
as a result can generate negative-valued predictions and forecasts.</p>

Similar to the NaiveArima model, Random Walk has an ARIMA order of
(0,1,0), but in Random Walk, it is the underlying density that takes a
random walk on the log scale, whereas in NaiveArima, it is the raw
counts that take a random walk on the observation scale. There are two
process parameters – mu (the density of the species at the beginning of
the time series) and sigma (the standard deviation of the random walk,
which is Gaussian on the log scale). The observation model has no
additional parameters. The prior distributions for mu is informed by the
available data collected prior to the start of the data used in the time
series. mu is normally distributed with a mean equal to the average
log-scale density and a standard deviation of 0.04. sigma was given a
uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The Random Walk model is fit and

<p>Logistic fits a hierarchical log-scale density logistic growth model

Gaussian on the log scale), r (growth rate), and K (carrying capacity).
The observation model has no additional parameters. The prior
distributions for mu and K are slightly informed in that they are vague
but centered using the available data and sigma and r are set with vague
priors. mu is normally distributed with a mean equal to the average
log-scale density and a standard deviation of 0.04. K is modeled on the
log-scale with a prior mean equal to the log maximum count and a
standard deviation of 0.04. r is given a normal prior with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.04. sigma was given a uniform distribution between

expands upon the “process model” underlying the Poisson observations.
There are six process parameters – mu (the density of the species at the
beginning of the time series), sigma (the standard deviation of the
random walk, which is Gaussian on the log scale), and then intercept and
slope parameters for r (growth rate) and K (carrying capacity) as a
function of covariates (r being a function of the integrated warm rain
over the past 3 lunar months and K being a function of average NDVI over
the 13 lunar months). The observation model has no additional
parameters. The prior distributions for mu and the K interceptare
slightly informed in that they are vague but centered using the
available data and sigma and r are set with vague priors. mu is normally
distributed with a mean equal to the average log-scale density and
standard deviation 0.04. The K intercept is modeled on the log-scale
with a prior mean equal to the maximum count and standard deviation
0.04. The r intercept is given a normal prior with mean 0 and standard
deviation 0.04. sigma was given a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
The slopes for r and log-scale K were given priors with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1. The Logistic Covariates model is fit and forecast

<p>Logistic Competition fits a hierarchical log-scale density logistic
growth model with a Poisson observation process using the JAGS (Just
Another Gibbs Sampler) infrastructure <span class="citation">(Plummer
2003)</span>. Building upon the Logistic model, Logistic Competition
expands upon the “process model” underlying the Poisson observations.
There are six process parameters – mu (the density of the species at the
beginning of the time series), sigma (the standard deviation of the
random walk, which is Gaussian on the log scale), and then intercept and
slope parameters for r (growth rate) and K (carrying capacity) as a
function of competitior density (K being a function of current DO
counts). The observation model has no additional parameters. The prior
distributions for mu and the K intercept are slightly informed in that
they are vague but centered using the available data and sigma and r are
set with vague priors. mu is normally distributed with a mean equal to
the average log-scale density and standard deviation 0.04. The K
intercept is modeled on the log-scale with a prior mean equal to the
maximum of <code>past counts</code> and standard deviation 0.04. The r
intercept is given a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation
0.04. sigma was given a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The slope
for log-scale K was given a prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
The Logistic Competition model is fit and forecast using the
<strong>portalcasting</strong> functions <code>fit_runjags</code> and
<code>forecast.runjags</code> (called as <code>forecast</code>),
respectively.</p>

– mu (the density of the species at the beginning of the time series),
sigma (the standard deviation of the random walk, which is Gaussian on

integrated warm rain over the past 3 lunar months and K being a function
of average NDVI over the past 13 lunar months as well as a function of
current DO count). The observation model has no additional parameters.
The prior distributions for mu and the K intercept are are slightly

and sigma and r are set with vague priors. mu is normally distributed
with a mean equal to the average log-scale density and standard

intercept is given a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation
0.04. Sigma was given a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.001. The
slope for r was given a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation
1, whereas the normal priors for the log K slopes were given mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.0625. The Logistic Competition Covariates model is
fit and forecast using the <strong>portalcasting</strong> functions

<p>In addition to the base models, we include a starting-point ensemble.
Prior to v0.9.0, the ensemble was based on AIC weights, but in the shift
to separating the interpolated from non-interpolated data in model
fitting, we had to transfer to an unweighted average ensemble model. The
ensemble mean is calculated as the mean of all model means and the
ensemble variance is estimated as the sum of the mean of all model
variances and the variance of the estimated mean, calculated using the
unbiased estimate of sample variances.</p>

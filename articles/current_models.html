<p>We currently analyze and forecast rodent data at Portal using eight models: ESSS, AutoArima, NaiveArima, nbGARCH, nbsGARCH, pevGARCH, simplexEDM, and jags_RW <span class="citation">(WeecologyLab 2019)</span>. Each model has a function with its name (<em>e.g.</em>, <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">ESSS()</a></code>) which is called from an associated R script in the <code>models</code> subdirectory with its name (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>ESSS.R</code>)</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="esss">ESSS<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#esss"></a>
</h3>
<p>ESSS (Exponential Smoothing State Space) is a flexible exponential smoothing state space model <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span> fit to the interpolated data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model is selected and fitted using the <code>ets</code> and <code>forecast</code> functions in the <strong>forecast</strong> package <span class="citation">(Hyndman 2017)</span> with the <code>allow.multiplicative.trend</code> argument set to <code>TRUE</code> within the <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">ESSS()</a></code> function. Models fit using <code>ets</code> implement what is known as the “innovations” approach to state space modeling, which assumes a single source of noise that is equivalent for the process and observation errors <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, ESSS models are defined according to three model structure parameters: error type, trend type, and seasonality type <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>. Each of the parameters can be an N (none), A (additive), or M (multiplicative) state <span class="citation">(Hyndman et al. 2008)</span>. However, because of the difference in period between seasonality and sampling of the Portal rodents combined with the hard-coded single period of the <code>ets</code> function, we could not include the seasonal components to the ESSS model. ESSS is fit flexibly, such that the model parameters can vary from fit to fit.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="autoarima">AutoArima<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#autoarima"></a>

<p>AutoArima (Automatic Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a flexible Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model fit to the data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model is selected and fitted using the <code>auto.arima</code> and <code>forecast</code> functions in the <strong>forecast</strong> package <span class="citation">(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Hyndman 2017)</span> within the <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">AutoArima()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>Generally, ARIMA models are defined according to three model structure parameters: the number of autoregressive terms (p), the degree of differencing (d), and the order of the moving average (q), and are represented as ARIMA(p, d, q) <span class="citation">(Box and Jenkins 1970)</span>. While the <code>auto.arima</code> function allows for seasonal models, the seasonality is hard-coded to be on the same period as the sampling, which is not the case for the Portal rodent surveys. As a result, no seasonal models were evaluated. AutoArima is fit flexibly, such that the model parameters can vary from fit to fit.</p>

<p>NaiveArima (Naive Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a fixed Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model of order (0,1,0) fit to the data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model is selected and fitted using the <code>Arima</code> and <code>forecast</code> functions in the <strong>forecast</strong> package <span class="citation">(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Hyndman 2017)</span> within the <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">NaiveArima()</a></code> function.</p>

<p>nbGARCH (Negative Binomial Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model with overdispersion (<em>i.e.</em>, a negative binomial response) fit to the interpolated data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The model for each species and the community total is selected and fitted using the <code>tsglm</code> function in the <strong>tscount</strong> package <span class="citation">(Liboschik et al. 2017)</span> within the <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">nbGARCH()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>GARCH models are generalized ARMA models and are defined according to their link function, response distribution, and two model structure parameters: the number of autoregressive terms (p) and the order of the moving average (q), and are represented as GARCH(p, q) <span class="citation">(Liboschik et al. 2017)</span>. The nbGARCH model is fit using the log link and a negative binomial response (modeled as an over-dispersed Poisson), as well as with p = 1 (first-order autoregression) and q = 12 (approximately yearly moving average).</p>
<p>The <code>tsglm</code> function in the <strong>tscount</strong> package <span class="citation">(Liboschik et al. 2017)</span> uses a (conditional) quasi-likelihood based approach to inference and models the overdispersion as an additional parameter in a two-step approach. This two-stage approach has only been minimally evaluated, although preliminary simulation-based studies are promising <span class="citation">(Liboschik, Fokianos, and Fried 2017)</span>.</p>

<p>pevGARCH (Poisson Environmental Variable Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model fit to the interpolated data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The response variable is Poisson, and a variety of environmental variables are considered as covariates.

The pevGARCH model is fit using the log link and a Poisson response, as well as with p = 1 (first-order autoregression) and q = 12 (yearly moving average). The environmental variables potentially included in the model are min, mean, and max temperatures, precipitation, and NDVI.</p>
<p>The <code>tsglm</code> function in the <strong>tscount</strong> package <span class="citation">(Liboschik et al. 2017)</span> uses a (conditional) quasi-likelihood based approach to inference. This approach has only been minimally evaluated for models with covariates, although preliminary simulation-based studies are promising <span class="citation">(Liboschik, Fokianos, and Fried 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Each species is fit using the following (nonexhaustive) sets of the environmental covariates: * max temp, mean temp, precipitation, NDVI * max temp, min temp, precipitation, NDVI * max temp, mean temp, min temp, precipitation * precipitation, NDVI * min temp, NDVI * min temp * max temp * mean temp * precipitation * NDVI * -none-</p>
<p>The final model is an intercept-only model. The single best model of the 11 is selected based on AIC.</p>

<p>jags_RW fits a hierarchical log-scale density random walk model with a Poisson observation process using the JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) infrastructure <span class="citation">(Plummer 2003)</span> fit to the data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. Similar to the NaiveArima model, jags_RW has an ARIMA order of (0,1,0), but in jags_RW, it is the underlying density that takes a random walk on the log scale, whereas in NaiveArima, it is the raw counts that take a random walk on the observation scale. The jags_RW model is rather simple, but the <code><a href="../reference/prefab_model_functions.html">jags_RW()</a></code> function provides a starting template and underlying machinery for more articulated models using the JAGS infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are two process parameters: mu (the density of the species at the beginning of the time series) and tau (the precision (inverse variance) of the random walk, which is Gaussian on the log scale). The observation model has no additional parameters. The prior distributions for mu and tau are informed by the available data collected prior to the start of the data used in the time series. mu is normally distributed with a mean equal to the average log-scale density and a variance that is twice as large as the observed variance. Due to the presence of 0s in the data and the modeling on the log scale, an offset of <code>count + 0.1</code> is used prior to taking the log and then is removed after the reconversion (exponentiation) as <code>density - 0.1</code> (where <code>density</code> is on the same scale as <code>count</code>, but can take non-integer values).</p>

<p>jags_logistic fits a hierarchical log-scale density logistic growth model with a Poisson observation process using the JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) infrastructure <span class="citation">(Plummer 2003)</span> fit to the data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. Building upon the jags_RW model, jags_logistic expands upon the “process model” underlying the Poisson observations.</p>
<p>There are four process parameters: mu (the density of the species at the beginning of the time series) and tau (the precision (inverse variance) of the random walk, which is Gaussian on the log scale) for the starting value and r (growth rate) and K (carrying capacity) of the dynamic population. The observation model has no additional parameters.</p>
<p>The prior distributions for mu, tau, and K are informed by the available data collected prior to the start of the data used in the time series and r is set with a vague prior. mu is normally distributed with a mean equal to the average log-scale density and a variance that is twice as large as the observed variance. K is modeled on the log-scale with a prior mean and variance equal to the maximum of the past counts * 1.2. r is given a normal prior with mean 0 and variance 0.1. Due to the presence of 0s in the data and the modeling on the log scale, an offset of <code>count + 0.1</code> is used prior to taking the log and then is removed after the reconversion (exponentiation) as <code>density - 0.1</code> (where <code>density</code> is on the same scale as <code>count</code>, but can take non-integer values).</p>

<h3 id="ensemble">Ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ensemble"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to the base models, we include a starting-point ensemble. In versions before v0.9.0, the ensemble was based on AIC weights, but in the shift to separating the interpolated from non-interpolated data in model fitting, we had to transfer to an unweighted average ensemble model. The ensemble mean is calculated as the mean of all model means and the ensemble variance is estimated as the sum of the mean of all model variances and the variance of the estimated mean, calculated using the unbiased estimate of sample variances.</p>

<p>simplexEDM (simplex projection using Empirical Dynamic Modeling) is a state-space reconstruction model adapted for forecasting and fit to the interpolated data at the composite (full site and just control plots) spatial level and both the composite (community) and the articulated (species) ecological levels. The method uses time-delay embedding to reconstruct a state-space for the dynamics underlying a time series <span class="citation">(Packard et al. 1980, @Takens1981)</span>. A forecast from a point in the state space is then computed as a weighted average of the trajectories of nearest neighbors of that point, a minimal algorithm known as “simplex projection” <span class="citation">(Sugihara and May 1990)</span>.</p>
<p>In applications to ecological time series, many of the parameters are set automatically, with the exception of the dimension of the time-delay embedding. Here, the embedding dimension (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) is selected as the value (between <code>1</code> and the <code>max_E</code> argument to <code>simplexEDM()</code>) that minimizes the mean absolute error over the in-sample portion of the data.</p>
